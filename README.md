## Introduction
[Akshat](https://github.com/akshatvg)'s uncle was getting his company's website developed by a huge firm. The firm charged him lakhs of rupees for development and later told him that they wouldn't maintain the project or make changes unless he paid a hefty sum for maintenance.

Being web developers ourselves, we decided to make something to make it easy for anyone facing such issues.
